Swift Database is a standalone database library that enables communication to your favorite databases (ranked by market share) using the bare minimum dependencies.

We utilize the latest features of the Swift Language (actors, concurrency, inline arrays, macros, noncopyables, spans) to push performance to the absolute limits while still making it easy to use.

We provide blueprint modules that lay out the API of the inner workings of each database to perform optimally, empowering the developer to determine the data structures and types used (if you don't use the default implementations provided by us).
